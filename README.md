### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

# My name is PaweÅ‚ Brzozowski and I am a junior Swift/IOS developer. </br> <br>
Currently, I am a student at the PoznaÅ„ University of Technology, where I am learning all the things about robots and automation of processes and to be specific I am writing now my engineering thesis. </br>
I am extremely interested in new technologies, mobile development, machine learning, artificial intelligence, data science, and technology at it's finest. </br>
Most of the time I am learning to code some kind of mobile app in Swift or develop Python programs related to AI/ML/DS stuff.
Naturally then Swift and Python are my main programming languages however I know also a bit of Dart/Flutter, C++, and SQL. </br> </br>

I am definitely a team player who loves to talk with complete strangers about interesting topics. </br>
I know English and also I understand some basics of German. Besides that Polish is my native language. </br>
There is nothing that I am afraid to learn, I am willing to work on my skill all the time and I don't need a lot of time to adopt new technology. </br>
